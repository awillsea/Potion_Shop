# Potion_Shop
This Was A Capstone Project for Rocket Mortgages Devbuild Bootcamp.

For this APP we Took a third Party Harry Potter Potions & Wizards API and saved that info into a local database using MySQL. Then we made calls to that using C#. 
For the Front end of things we used angular and made the http calls to our c# side of things.

some Key Features:
used a Cookie to show the amount of items in the Cart
randomly Generated img for the potion cards
create your own potion
